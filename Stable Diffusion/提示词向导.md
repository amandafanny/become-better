## Prompt matrix

Separate multiple prompts using the `|` character, and the system will produce an image for every combination of them. For example, if you use `a busy city street in a modern city|illustration|cinematic lighting` prompt, there are four combinations possible (first part of the prompt is always kept):

- a busy city street in a modern city
- a busy city street in a modern city, illustration
- a busy city street in a modern city, cinematic lighting
- a busy city street in a modern city, illustration, cinematic lighting

Four images will be produced, in this order, all with the same seed and each with a corresponding prompt:

![](./img/prompt%20matrix.png)

## Infinite prompt length

Typing past standard 75 tokens that Stable Diffusion usually accepts increases prompt size limit from 75 to 150. Typing past that increases prompt size further. This is done by breaking the prompt into chunks of 75 tokens, processing each independently using CLIP's Transformers neural network, and then concatenating the result before feeding into the next component of stable diffusion, the Unet.

For example, a prompt with 120 tokens would be separated into two chunks: first with 75 tokens, second with 45. Both would be padded to 75 tokens and extended with start/end tokens to 77. After passing those two chunks though **CLIP**, we'll have two tensors with shape of `(1, 77, 768)`. Concatenating those results in `(1, 154, 768)` tensor that is then passed to **Unet** without issue.

### BREAK keyword

Adding a `BREAK` keyword (must be uppercase) fills the current chunks with padding characters. Adding more text after `BREAK` text will start a new chunk.

## Attention/emphasis

Using `()` in the prompt increases the model's attention to enclosed words, and `[]` decreases it. You can combine multiple modifiers:

- `a (word)` - increase attention to word by a factor of 1.1
- `a ((word))` - increase attention to word by a factor of 1.21 (= 1.1 \* 1.1)
- `a [word]` - decrease attention to word by a factor of 1.1
- `a (word:1.5)` - increase attention to word by a factor of 1.5
- `a (word:0.25)` - decrease attention to word by a factor of 4 (= 1 / 0.25)
- `a \(word\)` - use literal () characters in prompt

Specifying weight only works with `()` not with `[]`

## Prompt editing

Prompt editing allows you to start sampling one picture, but in the middle swap to something else.

```
[from:to:when]
```

- `[to:when]` - adds to to the prompt after a fixed number of steps (when)
- `[from::when]` - removes from from the prompt after a fixed number of steps (when)

### Example:

- `a [fantasy:cyberpunk:16] landscape`
  At start, the model will be drawing a fantasy landscape.
  After step 16, it will switch to drawing a cyberpunk landscape, continuing from where it stopped with fantasy.

### Example with multiple edits:

`fantasy landscape with a [mountain:lake:0.25] and [an oak:a christmas tree:0.75][ in foreground::0.6][ in background:0.25] [shoddy:masterful:0.5]` (sampler has 100 steps)

- at start, fantasy landscape with a mountain and an oak in foreground shoddy
- after step 25, fantasy landscape with a lake and an oak in foreground in background shoddy
- after step 50, fantasy landscape with a lake and an oak in foreground in background masterful
- after step 60, fantasy landscape with a lake and an oak in background masterful
- after step 75, fantasy landscape with a lake and a christmas tree in background masterful

The picture at the top was made with the prompt:

`Official portrait of a smiling world war ii general, [male:female:0.99], cheerful, happy, detailed face, 20th century, highly detailed, cinematic lighting, digital art painting by Greg Rutkowski's

And the number 0.99 is replaced with whatever you see in column labels on the image.

The last column in the picture is `[male:female:0.0]`, which essentially means that you are asking the model to draw a female from the start, without starting with a male general, and that is why it looks so different from others.
