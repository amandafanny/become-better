### X/Y/Z plot

- Simple ranges:
  - 1-5 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Ranges with increment in bracket:
  - 1-5 (+2) = 1, 3, 5
  - 10-5 (-3) = 10, 7
  - 1-3 (+0.5) = 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3
- Ranges with the count in square brackets:
  - 1-10 [5] = 1, 3, 5, 7, 10
  - 0.0-1.0 [6] = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0

### Prompt S/R

Prompt S/R is one of more difficult to understand modes of operation for X/Y Plot. S/R stands for search/replace, and that's what it does - you input a list of words or phrases, it takes the first from the list and treats it as keyword, and replaces all instances of that keyword with other entries from the list.

For example, with prompt `a man holding an apple, 8k clean`, and Prompt S/R `an apple, a watermelon, a gun` you will get three prompts:

- a man holding an apple, 8k clean
- a man holding a watermelon, 8k clean
- a man holding a gun, 8k clean

The list uses the same syntax as a line in a CSV file, so if you want to include commas into your entries you have to put text in quotes and make sure there is no space between quotes and separating commas:

- `darkness, light, green, heat` - 4 items - `darkness`, `light`, `green`, `heat`
- `darkness, "light, green", heat` - WRONG - 4 items - `darkness`, `"light`, `green"`, `heat`
- `darkness,"light, green",heat` - RIGHT - 3 items - `darkness`, `light, green`, `heat`
